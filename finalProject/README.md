# Final Project: Tic-tac-toe (Javascript)

## Intro

I always enjoyed playing Tic-tac-toe, and already as a child, I came up with a strategy that I believe can not lose.</br>
For this project I wanted to create the code that will:
- Provide users the ability to play Tic-tac-toe against a program. 
- Create the logic for the program to play well.

### Note:
I am attempting also for the program to never lose.

## Game Rules
- The user will always start and will be the X symbol
- The program will be the O symbol
- The first to reach three of the same symbol in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
- Scores of all games are tracked and displayed.
- Play as many games as you want and try to beat the program!

## How To
To make it as simple as possible to start playing against my program, I am hosting it on my website.</br>
So all you need is an internet connection and a browser, so if you know the rules feel free to go to:</br>
### <ins> [Play Tic-tac-toe Now!](https://benjamingomori.com/TicTacToe.html) </ins>
</br>
Additionally, you can download all these files into a folder and open the TicTocToe.html file in your browser.


### Note
The program is meant to be played on a desktop/laptop and may have some visual limitations when trying to play on devices with small screens such as smartphones.

## Relation to Class
- I think that the complex logic of the program fits a scripting language course.
- Hosting it on my website is related to the server-related modules we covered in the course.
- The code is quite complex and includes many Javascript destructors such as arrays and dictionaries.
</br>
Additionally, the code also makes use of materials covered in other courses such as many HTML and CSS topics.
