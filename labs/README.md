# Lab 7 - Plugin/Package  (Python) - requests

## Intro
I chose to use the requests package.<br/>
The package can be used to easily manage rest API calls and responses.<br/>
I will use the package to GET, POST, DELETE from a free public API, https://gorest.co.in/, which has mock data.<br/>

## Install Package
```python -m pip install requests```

### Note:
Since the API creator requests that people do not share the access token on public websites I removed the token from the code and therefore the POST and DELETE will not work.
